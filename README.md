# Lock-Free Splay Tree (Charles Lu, Roland Liu)

##Summary
In our project, we plan on implementing a lock-free splay tree, a self-balancing binary tree that reduces access time of frequently accessed elements. We will build a sequential version, a lock version, and a lock-free version and run traces to compare their performance. We will likely be using pthreads for both concurrent implementations and mutex locks to implement the lock version.
